## Statistics on College Wide Receivers 

In this project college football statistics were collected and displayed on a website using various visualizations and sorted by the selected year. 

## Coding
1. First various football statistics were scraped data various football statistics from https://premium.pff.com. These statistics included RECV, TGT, Y/RR, ADOT, Man Vs Zone, Team Success, and YAC. Once the data was cleaned up it was transferred to an SQL database. 

2. Next the code is transferred to HTML using a Python Flask API (???)

3. Four visualizations were created using Javascript and HTML. The visualizations included a box & whisker plot that looks at RECV vs TGT, Y/RR, and ADOT, a scatter plot that looks at Y/RR Man vs Zone, a scatter plot Receiving Grade vs team success, and a bubble chart that looks at ADOT vs YAC. 

4. A drop down menu was created so the user can select the year for the statistics they want to see visualized.
